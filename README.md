# OnenoteMarkdownMacro
 AutoHotkey script to enable you to write "markdown" and have it formatted in onenote

 I was really annoyed that a solution didnt exist (or for free), so I made a quick set of macros to assist with using onenote like a markdown editor

 Features currently implemented:
- `##` for Title
- **\`** for `inline code blocks`
- Bold and italic with `*`
- Only runs macros if you are typing inside a onenote window


Featured I'd like to add eventually:
- Support for different levels of titles
- support for \`\`\` (three back tick) large code blocks

## Steps to use:
1. Install [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
2. Run the script
